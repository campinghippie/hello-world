practice how to create a new repository/life for Camping Hippie.

Camping Hippie 
--------------
Camping Hippie is a *moto-wildcamper* right now, for the love of nature and adventure and out of neccessity (lack of money...), but he learns software development and right now Github because his dream is to ***own*** a camping himself and live there.[^1] On the camping at the seaside, he will use desalinated water from the sea to create plantgrowth and shadow. Around the camping there will be an obstacle run-mountainbike trial-swimming triathlon course to get some movement in between coding and to atract the right type of sporty customers. On this parallel-trial there will be several points where the sporter receives coolant in the form of a desalinated seawater-shower, induced by a motion-sensor. Furthermore the obstacles/mountainbikepath will be original and challenging. It will be a camping focussed on digital nomads and also providing a living and workingspace for the people who work at his robotic company. At this robotic company robots will be produced for sustainable agriculture and, ofcourse, electric motorcycles!
In order to achieve all this, he needs robotic (software)skills. To learn this, Camping Hippie needs a strong **10 Commandments of Camping Conduct**: 
1. ~~working day and night~~
2. Code, Camp, Code, Motorcycle, Code, Socialize, Code, Motorcycle Maintenance, Code, Reading Book, Code, Surf, Code, Paraglide, Code etc.
3. Repeat everyday
4. Don't allow doubt, negative emotion, follow your ratio; this is a good plan, because with fun is slow, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast ü•á, keeping coding Happy üë±‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
5. stay the f** out of conflict, struggle, stay in the (github) Flow!
6. start out with ROBOSHOP.COM, a website focussed on selling robotic parts.
7. Hippie Doesn't focus on the goals mentioned above, the camping, the company, a lot of things are out of Hippies control. Instead, focus on the proces, little steps Camping Hippie makes to improve his income and software    knowledge.
8. Hippie will be proud on his transformation from inspiration to digitalisation, tuned out from his hallucinant fantasies dropping straight into the here and now, the right place and the right time, in TOTAL CONTROL and      stress free.
9. Hippie employs, but wil never be employed, being employed is incompatible with his independent personality, it gives him stress, and Hippie needs to avoid stress.
10. Besides coding, no more screentime during the workweek. Netflix and News will be replaced by sport and other leisure activities.

[^1] This is a good plan, because Camping Hippie will be able to generate a constant flow of income to pump into the camping business while being present there and be able to automise and robotize barriers, bartenders, booking etc. Digital Nomads who are fleeing from dark northern winters are always welcome!
