github practice how to create a new repository/life for Camping hippie.

Camping Hippie 
--------------
Camping Hippie is a *moto-wildcamper* right now, for the love of nature and adventure and out of neccessity (lack of money...), but he learns software development and right now Github because his dream is to ***own*** a camping himself and live there.[^1] Besides that he also wants to start a electric-hydrogen motorcycle company for wich he also needs robotic skills.

[^1] This is a good plan, because Camping Hippie will be able to generate a constant flow of income to pump into the camping business while being present there and be able to automise and robotize barriers, bartenders, booking etc. Digital Nomads who are fleeing from dark northern winters are always welcome!
