practice how to create a new repository/life for Camping hippie.

Camping Hippie 
--------------
Camping Hippie is a *moto-wildcamper* right now, for the love of nature and adventure and out of neccessity (lack of money...), but he learns software development and right now Github because his dream is to ***own*** a camping himself and live there.[^1] He also wants to start a electric-hydrogen motorcycle company for wich he also needs robotic software-skills.

In order to achieve all this, Camping Hippie needs a strong **Code of Camping Conduct**: 1. ~~working day and night~~
2. Work, Camp, Work, Motorcycle, Work, Socialize, work, Motorcycle Maintenance, Work, Reading Book, Work, Surf, Work, Paraglide, Work etc.
3. Repeat everyday
4. 4. Don't allow doubt, negative emotion, follow your ratio; this is a good plan, because with fun is slow, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast ü•á, keeping coding Happy üë±‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
5. stay the f** out of conflict, struggle, stay in the (github) Flow!

[^1] This is a good plan, because Camping Hippie will be able to generate a constant flow of income to pump into the camping business while being present there and be able to automise and robotize barriers, bartenders, booking etc. Digital Nomads who are fleeing from dark northern winters are always welcome!
